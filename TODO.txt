sort out int and float separate specs when other bugs fixed
lots of changes needed here:
mod -> fmod
floordiv in float needs floor function adding
not bitwise operator for float

and tests for the above obvsballs



work out some sort of class function implementation??
generally replace operations with function calls
 - have "InlineFunction" class where not needed - operation called on left operand only



Add more test functions
    Test failures:
        multiple return types
        add if branch checking to see if control reaches end of function, and generate return None

        starred arguments

        is and is not operators

        with blocks

    Test succeeds:

        General check c output against python output
        for loop
        while loop
        break
        continue
        pass

        imports

        lists
        strings
        subscripting - single index to start, then maybe slices...

        tuples

        dicts?
        classes - and associated attribute access....

        comprehensions
