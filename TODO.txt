sort out int and float separate specs when other bugs fixed
lots of changes needed here:
mod -> fmod
floordiv in float needs floor function adding
not bitwise operator for float

and tests for the above obvsballs

library imports need tidying - currently just missing stdio for print.

some more list actions??
list multiplication could be coool.... but would need to get temp variables up and running....

consider converting strings from struct wrapper to pure char arrays to simplify c code
would need to make an assign function on types

work out some sort of class function implementation??
 - working on it



Add more test functions
    Test failures:
        starred arguments

        is and is not operators

        with blocks

    Test succeeds:

        General check c output against python output
        for loop
        while loop
        break
        continue

        imports

        strings
        subscripting - single index to start, then maybe slices...

        tuples

        dicts?
        classes - and associated attribute access....

        comprehensions
